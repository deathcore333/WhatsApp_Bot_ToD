Simple Truth or Dare Game
This is a command-line based Truth or Dare game made in Python.

How to Play
Run the executable file tod.py on the command-line.
Pass the argument play to the file to initiate the game: python tod.py play.
The game will ask you to set a punishment for failing to complete a Truth or Dare challenge.

After completing the challenge, the game will ask if the player wants to continue.
